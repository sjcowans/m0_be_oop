# Self Evaluation

- This final CFU encompassed everything you've learned in Mod 0, and maybe even required some learning outside of what you've explicitly been taught. How did it feel as you faced these challenges?

I felt very engaged and positively stimulated by the challenges!

- How is your workflow going, in terms of taking breaks, staying focused, etc.?

I definitely need to take more breaks, but I feel good with my focus.

- What do you need to do to be ready for intense technical lessons and challenges like this, for 6 hours/day next week? What support do you need?

I just need to do more practice and research so I don't struggle conceptually.
